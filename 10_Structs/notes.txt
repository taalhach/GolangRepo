composite type
enclosing different types in one type
properties are called fields
fields with same types can be written in one line
e.g
name father_name string
literals meaning value itself means value of a variable is literal
x= 3 where x is variable and 3 is literal


new allocates memory and zero values to variables of type T


embedding ==> using one type in other (super) type or as a field of super type
